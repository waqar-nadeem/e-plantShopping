Final project for IBM Front-End development certification, building a responsive React-based shopping application designed for browsing and purchasing houseplants. Built with React functional components, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Vite for fast builds, the app features a multi-page layout including a landing page, product catalog, and interactive shopping cart. Users can explore categorized plant listings, add items to their cart, adjust quantities, and view real-time updates to totals and item counts. The UI is styled with CSS Flexbox to ensure accessibility and smooth performance across devices. This repository serves as a final frontend project submission, showcasing best practices in component composition, state handling, and responsive design. Open for review, collaboration, and educational use.
